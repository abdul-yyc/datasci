I wasn't able to find it, so I will make some conclusions here based on assuming Eastern Time Zone which may make some sense based on my observations.\n",

This would make sense to me if the majority of the responders by comment are in the school age range. That time period is about when students get out of school. However, the age of responders is not given in this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the results above suggests that 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is the peak period for comment volume per post, **regardless of day of the week!** This may not be true for Saturday and Sunday since school is not attended on the weekend. Also, if we created a histogram for average comments per post by hour, the distribution would not be Unimodal with only one peak (at 15:00), but would be Multi-Modal with 3 peaks; the top 3 times as shown above (3:00 PM, 2:00 AM and 8:00 PM).

    "## Conclusions and Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The peak hours for average number of comments per post are **not the same for each day of the week!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "For Monday through Friday, 3:00 PM is still the dominant peak, either the top one or in the top 3. This would make sense if the majority of the \"comment responders\" were students just after getting out of school between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, on the weekend, the peak hours of average comments per post on Saturday and Sunday, are either \"late-late\" night (12:00 midnight - 3:00 AM) or \"mid-evening\" (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM). The mid-evening peak is also true for Friday night.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, during which hours should I create a question type post to have a higher chance of receiving comments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Well the answer is: \"It depends\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it depends on the type of question I intend to pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, it depends on whether I have access during week days to \"Hacker News\" between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM. (i.e. possibly restricted by my employer if I'm employed). If I'm unemployed or retired, then I would have freedom to pose questions in that time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say I do have access to posting in \"Hacker News\" on week days between 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM. If I'm interested in comments from the younger generation, then I would post in that time frame on either Monday (97 comments per post) or Thursday (60 comments per post). On the other hand, if the type of question I want to pose is totally irrelevant to the younger generation, then I would most likely choose the best posting time period on the weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm a working person without access to \"Hackers News\" during the week days ay 3:00 PM, then I would most likely post \"mid-evening\" (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM) either Friday (46 comments per post) or Sunday (50 comments per post).\n",
    "\n",
    "Saturday morning at 2:00 AM had a higher average (102 comments per post), but I'm not keen on staying up that late just to pose a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that all of the average comments per post determined by taking day of the week into consideration (lowest was 46 and highest was 102) are greater than the highest average across all days of the week (38). **Digging Deeper** was worth the extra time and effort to get more details and improve accuracy of conclusion!"
